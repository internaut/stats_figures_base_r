## Overview

This repository contains an RMarkdown document with figures for statistics and data science education created with base R plotting methods. It's intended to be used as resource for other teachers in these fields and for those who want to learn more about base R plotting, especially about typesetting mathematical notation in R plots (and its many quirks!). 

The rendered document is available at [internaut.github.io/stats_figures_base_r/](https://internaut.github.io/stats_figures_base_r/).
